# LoanVision
LoanVision uses machine learning to predict  whether a loan would be approved or not based on a given set of independent variables (s).

# The project uses the following steps:
## 1. Data preparation: 
 The data is pre-processed to remove missing values and outliers. The data is also split into a training set and a test set.
## 2. Feature engineering: 
 The features in the data are engineered to improve the performance of the machine learning models.
## 3. Model training: 
A variety of machine learning models are trained on the training set. The models are evaluated on the test set to select the best model.
## 4. Model evaluation: 
The best model is evaluated on the test set to measure its accuracy.

# The project uses the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot 
- seaborn 
- scikit-learn
